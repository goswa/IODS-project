# Hello
The whole world is getting **digital**, thus, developing analytical and quantitative skills are essential these days. Being a doctoral student, it is beneficial to have a deep understanding of *data wrangling* and *analysis*. The overall insight of the course looks interesting and synchronized. I am looking forward to see new methods arriving in R every week. The course **"Introduction to Open Data Science 2018"** is worth learning.
